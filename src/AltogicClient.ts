/**
 * Javascript client for interacting with your backend applications developed in Altogic.
 *
 * AltogicClient is the main object that you will be using to issue commands to your backend apps. The commands that you can run are grouped below:
 * * {@link auth}: {@link AuthManager} - Manage users and user sessions
 * * {@link endpoint}: {@link EndpointManager} - Make http requests to your app endpoints and execute associated services
 * * {@link db}: {@link DatabaseManager} - Perform CRUD (including lookups, filtering, sorting, pagination) operations in your app database
 * * {@link queue}: {@link QueueManager} - Enables you to run long-running jobs asynchronously by submitting messages to queues
 * * {@link cache}: {@link CacheManager} - Store and manage your data objects in high-speed data storage layer (Redis)
 * * {@link task}: {@link TaskManager} - Manually trigger execution of scheduled tasks (e.g., cron jobs)
 * * {@link realtime}: {@link RealtimeManager} - Publish and subscribe (pub/sub) realtime messaging through websockets
 *
 * Each AltogicClient can interact with one of your app environments (e.g., development, test, production). You cannot create a single client to interact with multiple development, test or production environments at the same time. If you would like to issue commands to other environments, you need to create additional AltogicClient objects using the target environment's `envUrl`.
