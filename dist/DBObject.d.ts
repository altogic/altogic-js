/**
 * References an object stored in a specific model of your application. It provides the methods to get, update, delete an existing object identified by its id or create, set or append a new object.
 *
 * If id is provided when creatign an instance, you can use {@link get}, {@link update}, {@link delete} and {@link updateFields} methods. If no id specified in constructor, you can use {@link create}, {@link set}, and {@link append} methods to create a new object in the database.
 *
 * {@link create} method is used to creat a top-level object, which does not have any parent. {@link set} method is used to set the value of an `object` field of a parent object and finally {@link append} is used to add a child object to an `object-list` field of a parent object.
 *
 * Since both {@link set} and {@link append} operate on a sub-model or sub-model list object respectively, you need to pass a `parentId` as an input parameter.
