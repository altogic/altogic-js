 * The queue manager allows different parts of your application to communicate and perform activities asynchronously.
 *
 * A message queue provides a buffer that temporarily stores messages and dispatches them to their consuming service. The messages are usually small, and can be things like requests, replies or error messages, etc.
 *
 * Typically, in Altogic, you submit messages to a queue in your backend app services using the **Submit Message to Queue** node. However, with Altogic's client API by calling the {@link submitMessage} method, you can manually send messages to your selected queue for processing.
