 * HTTP client for the browser, Node or React Native. Created by {@link AltogicClient} during initialization. The client library uses [cross-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) under the hood to make requests to you app's execution environment.
 *
 * When creating the client if `apiKey` is specified in {@link ClientOptions}, Fetcher adds the provided apiKey to an **Authorization** header and sends it in all RESTful API requests to your backend app.
 *
 * Similarly, if there is an active user session, Fetcher also adds the session token to a **Session** header and sends it in all RESTful API requests to your backend app.
